# DanderSpirtz documentation
The goal of this project is to document the different capabilities and functionality of the DanderSpirtz post-exploitation framework / application by examining the contents of the "resources" folder included in the ShadowBrokers leak and doing live testing of the system.

_**Note**_: This repository does **not** contain all of the FuzzBunch code, exploits, binaries, etc. The repository _only_ contains the files found in the _Windows/Resources/_ directory included in the leak. 

**This repository alone is not enough to run DanderSpritz.** 

If you're interested in viewing the entire contents of the leak use this repo:

[EQGRP\_Lost\_in_Translation](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP\_Lost\_in\_Translation)

# Python bytecode has been decompiled
The original ShadowBrokers leak had most of the python scripts compiled into optimized bytecode (.pyo). In order to make this reversing / documentation effort easier I've decompiled the code and uploaded the "raw" python code to this repository

The original python bytecode files have been left intact

# Resource Codenames and capabilities
The sub-directories in the "Resources" directory contain different modules which are used by DanderSpirtz to provide capabilities such as packet capture, memory dumps, etc. 

Below are the codenames that correspond to the different modules and the potential capabilities based on examining the python code, comments, XML, available "command" txt files

|**TeDi**                  | _**TerritorialDispute**_ | A plugin used to determine what other (malicious) software may be persistently installed (based on TeDi/PyScripts/sigs.py). Appears to be used to identify other nation states also |
